# Record Management System

A sleek, mobile-first desktop application for managing personal or organization records. Developed using Python's Tkinter framework and SQLite for local data persistence.

## Features
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for a 400x700 aspect ratio with a clean, modern UI.
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete records effortlessly.
- **Advanced Validation**:
    - Contact numbers are strictly limited to **11 digits**.
    - Real-time restriction prevents non-numeric input in the contact field.
    - Robust email validation requiring the "@" symbol.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Intelligently blocks duplicate entries based on Name or Email collisions.
- **Premium Aesthetics**: Elevated cards, simulated shadows, and structured data layouts for a high-end feel.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Runs on standard Python 3.x with no external libraries required.

## Installation & Usage

   ```

## Technical Details
